#Socialize (sZ) - Social Sharing Buttons   
==============

This repo consists of the code needed to create custom social sharing buttons, while matching the API standards of each social media site.  

Each file has 2 versions:   
-  regular (\*.html)   
-  commented (\*-c.html)   

## Notes   

All links have two classes:   
- **sZ-button** - this class is shared throughout all the buttons
- **sZ-facebook** - where "facebook" is replaced with the respective social media site name


### Facebook

>"Facebook deprecated the Share button on February 28, which means they no longer recommend its use in applications or on external web sites. The share button still works as of now, but Facebook will de-prioritize maintenance of the feature."
