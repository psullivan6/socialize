#Socialize (sZ) - Social Sharing Buttons   
==============
This repo consists of the code needed to create custom social sharing buttons, while matching the API standards of each social media site.  

## Notes   
All links have two classes:   
- **sZ-button** - this class is shared throughout all the buttons
- **sZ-facebook** - where "facebook" is replaced with the respective social media site name
