	[ Email Button ]
	=======================================
		Basic Link tag that can be customized.
		I use the onclick action just for a consistent UX (Facebook JS uses a similar popup).

	[ VARIABLE ]
	=======================================
	Google's so awesome that they'll pull all the article, post, etc... content from the URL for you.
	(double-click the name and replace all for ease of use)
			
		EMAIL_RECIPIENT		The email address of the recipient
					** I suggest using yourname@domain.com or some other generic placeholder because this field is required
								
		EMAIL_SUBJECT		The subject line of the email ** make sure to escape all the characters
		EMAIL_BODY		The body section of the email ** make sure to escape all the characters
