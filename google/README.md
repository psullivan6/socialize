http://bit.ly/g-button   

## Notes   
The onclick action on the link tag is used for a consistent UX (The Facebook JS uses a similar popup).   

## Variables   
	SHARE_LINK_HERE		The link of the item to be shared (shortened = better)   
	*Google's so awesome that they'll pull all the shared item's content from the URL.*
